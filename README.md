I assert that the work we submitted is 100% my own. I have not received any
part from any other student in the class, nor have I give parts of it for use to others.
Nor have I used code from other sources: Courses taught previously at this university,
courses taught at other universities, various bits of code found on the Internet, etc.
I realize that should our code be found to contain code from other sources, that a 
formal case shall be opened against us with va’adat mishma’at, in pursuit of disciplinary
action.
